## About me
I began my adventure in a programming word in 2020 in [21 programming school](https://21-school.ru/). For the first year I was learning C language, then C++ language.
At last I decided to be a front-end developer and started studying JS [here](https://learn.javascript.ru/). Then I knew about [RS school](https://rs.school/) and I became a student there. I studied [JS stage 0](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) in summer 2022. Now I 'm learning a [JS](https://rs.school/js/) course.
